		<h2>About this site</h2>
        <p>This website is constantly <strong>evolving</strong> along with my <em>skills</em>. As I continue to <u>learn and grow</u>, this website will also change to visually <strong>look better</strong> and contain <strong><u>more content</u></strong></p>
        <p>This site can act not only as a resume for employers, but also as a place for me to dump whatever content I wish, which hopefully can help out others in the future</p>
